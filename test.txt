Navigating the Web: A Guide to Spotting & Avoiding Online Scams.

The internet is a great place to connect with friends, learn new things, and shop for bargains. But it's also a place where scammers try to trick people into giving them money or personal information.

Here are some tips on how to spot and avoid scams online:

1) Question the Unbelievable. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often promise you big rewards to get you to give them your money.
2) Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from people you don't know. These links or attachments could take you to fake websites that look like real ones, or they could contain viruses that could steal your personal information.
3) Never give out your personal information to someone you met online. This includes your name, address, phone number, password, or credit card number.
4) If you're not sure whether something is a scam, it is a scam. Google is you friend. If it's legit, you'll find reviews. If it's a scam, others have likely sounded the alarm.

Here are some additional red flags to watch out for:

1) The email or website is full of typos or grammatical errors.
2) The email or website asks you to act immediately.
3) The email or website threatens you with something bad if you don't do what they say.

If you think you've been scammed, there are things you can do:

1) Report the scam to the authorities.
2) Contact your bank or credit card company and let them know what happened.
3) Change your passwords for all of your online accounts.

By following these tips, you can help protect yourself from online scams. Share this with your friends and family so they are safe on the Internet too. Namaste!
